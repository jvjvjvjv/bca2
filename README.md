Blast common ancestor using entrez e-utilities

Blasts all the sequences in a file and generates a consensus taxonomic identity for the sequence by finding the last common ancestor of each of the top N hits over a given e-value threshold.

**This script is intended to replace the older blast-common-ancestor script**
It's faster now since it blasts all the sequences at once
